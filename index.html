                    Hello, my name is Jacob Nordstrom. I am in my second semester of Computer Programming. I initially got into programming about 2 years ago when I discovered game development. I've since learned a couple languages such as; Javascript, Python and C#, and am currently developinig using Unity. I'm mostly interested in learning more about web development tools and getting a job as a front end developer, but I'm not entirely sure what I want to do yet, so that could change. I also enjoy playing video games in my spare time or browsing Youtube.
                </p>
